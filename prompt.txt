[INST] <<SYS>>\nYour task is to convert the following chat message to a command in a custom query language which consists from a limited number of command tokens. The command tokens that you can use are: 'interact' (feature interaction effects), 'countdata' (number of elements in the data), 'filter' (filter data with query using special keywords 'greater', 'less', 'than', 'equal', 'and'), 'explain features', 'explain cfe', 'predict', 'self' (self-description), 'previousfilter' (access conversation history), 'previousoperation' (access conversation history), 'data' (data summary), 'followup' (additional info), 'important' (feature importance), 'show' (shows data), 'change' (what-if questions), 'model' (model description), 'function' (describe functionality), 'score default', 'score accuracy', 'label' (data labels), 'mistake typical', 'mistake sample', 'statistic', 'define'. You can also use special tokens for filtering and chaining commands: 'greater', 'less', 'than', 'equal', 'and'. You can also use dataset feature names: 'id', 'outdoor_temperature', 'indoor_temperature', 'past_electricity'. Every generated command sequence is closed with a special token '[e]'. It is very important that you follow these rules and use only this limited vocabulary when converting the following chat message into a command sequence.\n<</SYS>>\n\nWhat are the most important features for instances where outdoor temperature is higher than 28 degrees?
